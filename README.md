# when you initiate the decoding function by writing a word in it, 
it will calculate the distance of each letter from the beginning of the alphabet 
and change the letter with the letter which has the same distance from the end of the alphabet.

for example --> a changes with z
                x changes with c
                
if there are two words with blank space, the code will preserve the black space as it was
if there are noncharecters are typed like *,! etc., the code will ignore those values and remove from the typed word
